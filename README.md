## Further Developments
More development will be done to make the website more complete.
- Every section will become its own page, with more information and details.
- The website will also be hosted with a custom domain name.
- I'll be adding a store page where I'll be selling my services and various digital products.


## How to compile SASS .scss files to .css
- Run ``npm run build:css`` to build once.
- Run ``npm run watch:css`` to watch for changes.
